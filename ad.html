    <h2><small>Seriously. Not matter what you use our app for, you should never have to worry
        about your private information getting into the wrong hands.</small></h2>
    <p>While other social media sites want to conect people on their terms,
      we want to give the power of connection back to you. We believe our role should be to
      connect people to each other, not viewing their messages.
      <br> We only ever ask for your phone number.
      Our app creates a social web through which you can communicate, but allthe messaging is done
      through your texting servce provider. For this reason, we will never see what you
      send.</p>

    <h1>Your security matters.</h1>
    <h2><small>Seriously. Not matter what you use our app for, you should never have to worry
        about your private information getting into the wrong hands.</small></h2>
    <p>While other social media sites want to conect people through their service,
      we just want to connect people. This is why we only ever ask for your phone number.
      Our app creates a social web through which you can communicate, but all the messaging is done
      through your texting servce provider. For this reason, we will never see what you
      send.
      <br><strong>We highly reccomend using <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> to send messages and calls.</strong></p>
